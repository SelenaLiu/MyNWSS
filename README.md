# MyNWSS
IOS app project for New Westminster Secondary School.

Currently one of the largest high schools in British Columbia, New Westminster Secondary is the hub of our community. 
Opened over 75 years ago, NWSS is home to many programsÂ that give students an opportunity to learn new skills and fuel their passions. 
From the International Baccalaureate program, Apprenticeship & Applied Technologies, Performing Arts and Musical Theatre and a variety of Sports Academies, 
New Westminster offers so much that it is hard to stay connected to all that goes on here. It is this problem where student Selena Liu wanted to give back 
to her school community. An app to stay connected.
